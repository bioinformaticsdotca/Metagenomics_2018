These answers are for the CBW Metagenomics [integrated assignment](https://github.com/gavinmdouglas/Metagenomics_2018/blob/master/integrated_assignment.md).

### 16S:


### MGS:

1. Sample A2 has the fewest filtered reads (2548811 pairs).

1. 69 independent species were identified.

1. Sample C2's relative abundane values are the furthest from summing to 100.

1. Sample B1 has the fewest observed species (3), which you could figure out by typing: ```colSums(mgs_sp_relab > 0)```.

1. _Pseudomonas_.

1. Between C1 and C2: 0.6504148. Between C1 and B1: -0.159787 (and not significant!)

1. Yes this pathway is at high relative abundance in both artic wolves and coyotes, but is low or absent in the other mammals.

1. 0.1038
